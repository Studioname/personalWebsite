        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>I like to write code in Python</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am self taught and inexperienced</p>
        <br>
        <p>And there is always more to learn</p>
        <br>
        <p>But that is okay</p>
        <br>
        <p>Because I like learning</p>

          <h3>Computer Programming</h3>
          <p>I am always trying to become better at coding. I started with GML
            and decided to make a card game. I made the engine and decided to learn a more popular programming
             language. Since I am autistic and 30 something I didn't think re-entering
             education would be a good idea - So I decided to teach myself.</p>

          <h3>Cooking</h3>
          <p>My favourite things to cook are goulash, fajitas, and meditteranean style couscous. I use a smoker during summer and winter. In summer it is great for barbeque ribs. In winter you can smoke meat and cheese.</p>

          <h3>Baking</h3>
          <p>I like to bake sourdough bread. Nothing compares
          to a spelt and rye loaf. Seeds make a big difference - They give the bread a nutty flavour. A cast iron dutch oven gives a nice crust and ensures even thermal spread.</p>

          <h3>Computers</h3>
          <p>My Dad was a software developer. He had an Apricot, Macintosh and an Amiga before a Windows computer. I have been interested in computers since a young age.</p>

          <h3>Computer Games</h3>
          <p>My main interest was in computer games. My Dad let us play games on his computer while supervised. The morning after he got the Amiga I set it up and played Bomb Jack. I mostly play games now to connect with family.</p>
